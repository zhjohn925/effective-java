--interface .vs. abstract class .vs. concrete class
  1. if we donot know anything about implementation just we have requirement
     specification (100% abstract) then we should go for interface.
     Example: Servlet
  2. if we are talking about implementation but not completely (partial
     implementation) then we should go for abstract class.
     Example: GenericServlet & HTTPServlet
  3. if we are talking about implementation completely and ready to provide
     service then we should go for concrete class.
     Example: MyOwnServlet

--interface .vs. abstract
  1a. interface is also considered as 100% pure abstract class.
      every method is always public and abstract whether we are
      declaring or not.
  1b. the method in abstract class need not be public and abstract.
      in adddition to abstract methods we can take concrete methods also.
  2a. we can't declare interface method with the following modifiers.
      public so not--> private, protected
      abstract so not--> final, static, synchronized, native, strictfp
  2b. There are no restriction on abstract class method modifiers.
  3a. -variables in interface are always public, static, and final
       whether we are declaring or not. we can't declare variables with
      -the following modifiers: private, protected, transient, volatile
      -for interface variables compulsory we should perform initialization
       at the time of declaration otherwise we will get compile time error.
  3b. -the variables in abstract class need not be public, static and final.
      -there are no restriction on abstract class variable modifiers.
      -For abstract class variables it is not required to perform
       initialization at the time of declaration.
  4a. Inside interface we can't declare instance and static blocks.
  4b. Inside abstract class we can declare instance and static blocks.
  5a. Inside interface, we can't declare constructor
  5b. Inside abstract class we can declare constructor, which will be
      executed at the time of child object creation.
